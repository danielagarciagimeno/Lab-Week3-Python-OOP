<details>
  <summary>
   <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  </summary>

  This lab allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. 

  Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:
  
- Understand the key concepts of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, attributes, and methods, and how they relate to Python programming.
- Use Python classes and objects to build solutions that leverage the power of object-oriented programming.
- Apply the principles of encapsulation and inheritance to create modular, extensible, and reusable code.
- Utilize class attributes and methods to define the behavior of objects and control their interactions with other objects and the environment.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming lab! This lab is designed to help you apply the concepts you have learned about object-oriented programming in Python. Through a series of programming exercises, you will learn how to use classes, objects, and inheritance.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a way of modeling real-world objects as software objects. By using OOP, you can reduce the complexity of code and make it more robust, maintainable, and scalable, saving time and effort in the development process. 

In addition, many data analytics tools and libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, use OOP concepts, and it is essential for data analysts to understand these concepts to be able to use these tools effectively. OOP can also help data analysts to create custom data structures and algorithms that are tailored to their specific needs, which can help to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis.

The lab consists of a series of programming exercises that will guide you through the process of building different applications using object-oriented programming concepts. You will start by defining classes and objects, and then you will learn how to use inheritance to create more complex programs. You will also practice encapsulation, which is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary functionality.


**Happy coding!** :heart:

## FAQs
<details>
  <summary>I am stuck in the exercise and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start.</summary>
  <br>

  If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear question about the specific issue you are facing. This will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions.


  For example, is it a concept that you don't understand, or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources. 


  Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you will be able to start working toward the solution.

  <summary>I am unable to push changes to the repository. What should I do?</summary>
  <br>

There are a couple of possible reasons why you may be unable to *push* changes to a Git repository:

1. **You have not committed your changes:** Before you can push your changes to the repository, you need to commit them using the `git commit` command. Make sure you have committed your changes and try pushing again. To do this, run the following terminal commands from the project folder:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  git push
  ```
2. **You do not have permission to push to the repository:** If you have cloned the repository directly from the main Ironhack repository without making a *Fork* first, you do not have write access to the repository.
To check which remote repository you have cloned, run the following terminal command from the project folder:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
If the link shown is the same as the main Ironhack repository, you will need to fork the repository to your GitHub account first and then clone your fork to your local machine to be able to push the changes.

**Note**: You should make a copy of your local code to avoid losing it in the process.
